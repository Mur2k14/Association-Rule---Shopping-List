# Association-Rule---Shopping-List
We have seen this multiple times whilst shopping in online retailers like flipkart, amazon and a few others.
Many a times, while i was looking for products i get suggestions to buy another product.
Always had me wondering how they were able to do such predictions.
So, upon searching i was able to find out the ML algorithm behind it.
The associative learning specifically Apriori model was the ML algorithm that was used to find such suggestions
Here, the model was applied to the dataset that was obtained from a retail store, to find which products were frequently brought together by the consumers.
